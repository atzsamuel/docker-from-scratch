#Docker multi-stage
# First install dependencies and execute tests
FROM node:14.5.0-alpine3.12 as build
RUN mkdir -p /home/node/app/node_modules && chown -R node:node /home/node/app
WORKDIR /home/node/app
COPY app/ ./
USER node
RUN npm install
RUN npm test
# Second copy files application and expose port and running
FROM node:14.5.0-alpine3.12 as runtime
WORKDIR /home/node/app
COPY --from=build  /home/node/app ./
EXPOSE 8080
CMD ["node", "app"]
# For build docker multi-stage 
docker build -t node-app-multi .
# For view image build 
docker images
# For run docker image node-app-multi
docker run -d -p 8081:8080 node-app-multi
# You can view your docker file running in
http://localhost:8081

# DOCKER MULTI-STAGE
# This functionality is more for solutions compilated 
# For example first compilate image and later copy image compilated only with runtime 
# Other example, first we have .NET SDK and later  .NET RUNTIME
https://hub.docker.com/_/microsoft-dotnet-sdk
https://hub.docker.com/_/microsoft-dotnet-runtime

# Execute following command
docker pull mcr.microsoft.com/dotnet/sdk
# Later execute following command
docker pull mcr.microsoft.com/dotnet/runtime
# Diference between size is .net skd 705MG and size .net runtime 190MG
docker images

# PUBLISH DOCKER IMAGE
# For upload docker enter your username and password created in https://hub.docker.com 
docker login
# Firts name of image need name of your username then rename your image with following command
docker tag node-app-multi atzsamuel/node-app:v1
